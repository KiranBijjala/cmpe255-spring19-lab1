# Sentiment Analysis of Reviews for Yelp Dataset
# Introduction

Given the availability of large volume of online review data, Sentiment Analysis becomes increasingly important.In this project, a sentiment classifier is built which evalutes the polarity of text being either positive or negative or neutral.
Here, we perform sentiment Analysis for reviews of Yelp dataset by proposing a solution using Logistic Regression using Scikit Learn. The preprocessed data is used to find the sentiment of the reviews with the help of a set of positive and negative keywords. 

# Data Preprocessing

The Yelp Dataset is used for this project. Place the "yelp_reviews.csv", "pos_words.txt" and "neg_words.txt" in your working directory to easily import the files into your code.
